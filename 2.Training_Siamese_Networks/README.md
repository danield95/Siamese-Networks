# Training Siamese Networks

## Introduction

In this mini-project, I will learn how to train siamese networks with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

## Goal

Using the siamese network implementation, I will be able to:

- Present two input images to our network.
- The network will predict whether or not these two images belong to the same class (i.e., verification).
- Iâ€™ll then be able to check the confidence score of the network to confirm the verification.

## Input 

The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) handwritten digit dataset.

## Outputs
